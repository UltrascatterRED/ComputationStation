CLEANUP:
DONE* refactor to enums from hard-coded strings (where appropriate)
DONE* define meshes' initial size instead of scaling in the transform menu
DONE* [maybe] look into _init() function use to have actual constructors for each
  node to avoid multi-line initialization in parent node func (increased chance
  for developer error)
* [maybe] Learn how to write method descriptions (show up on hover like in C#) and write them
* [maybe] Lookup arrays for component scene paths; fewer points of error/failure bc no more
  hard-coded strings

IMPLEMENT:
* Ability for player to place components and wires
  > a menu of some kind to select thing to place
  > "Ghost" components/wires that follow player mouse to provide visual feedback during
    placement
